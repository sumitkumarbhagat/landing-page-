Licensed from the original English Royal Enfield by the indigenous Indian Madras Motors, the company is now a subsidiary of Eicher Motors, an Indian automaker.The company makes classic-looking motorcycles including the Royal Enfield Bullet, Classic 350, Royal Enfield Thunderbird, Meteor 350, Classic 500, Interceptor 650, Continental, Hunter 350 and many more.</spam></p>

            <spam style="font-style:italic; font-size:18px; ">After the Indian Independence Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its army to patrol the country's border. In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike for the job. In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components. By 1962, all the components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc and 500 cc models, along with several different models for different market segments.
            In the year 1990, Royal Enfield collaborated with the Eicher Group, an automotive company in India, and merged with it in 1994. Apart from bikes, Eicher Group is involved in the production and sales of commercial vehicles and automotive gears.</spam> </p>

                        <h3 style="background-color:#5f7ca5;">Classic 350</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes, no matter how far away you see an unpleasant situation coming, it’s still impossible to take the bitterness and sting out of it. I always knew I would have to bid goodbye to our long-term Classic 350, and I didn’t need to spend too long with the bike to realise that it would be a tough one.
                            By the good grace of Royal Enfield, the affable little thumper has remained with us for longer than expected, which has turned out to be something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, I’m grateful for the extra time we’ve been given together. But that also means that my connection with the motorcycle has deepened even further, making it an even harder goodbye. And that’s despite the bike’s earnest efforts to make itself a little harder to love towards the end.In its last couple of months with us, the Classic undertook its biggest ever journey – a 1,300km round-trip to Goa, to attend India Bike Week. In many ways, it excelled. </p>
